Since childhood, I’ve always been fond of movies. During those 2 hours, you delve into the character, but as soon the screen flashes “The End”, the reality hits back again. But a question would always stuck me, **Why can’t I be the Chris Gardner in my life (In Pursuit of happiness) or the “Bunny” for my “Naina” (YJHD).**

Then I tried to find the differences, which made me realize some hard truths. Everyone gets bored quickly and people rarely have the patience which is needed. And, most of the people are not good with social interactions. But why!? — Because everything is easy nowadays and they rarely have any *meaningful* social interactions.

Then I started pondering on this situation. I started questioning myself and went through some online stuff to know what people have to say on this, what Real Human Interactions should demand and what these social media and phones have done to us.

People are busy in their phones, maintaining their fake personalities on so-called-social account, tagging and craving for their messenger to ring that bell like a toddler craves for his mother’s attention.

Everything has been objectified into clicks and swipes and has just become too easy for us. If you want to feel like a soldier, go watch Dunkirk. But you’ll never know what it takes to be a soldier, to be willing to DIE FOR OTHERS!! If you want to feel loved, go watch Amélie. But you’ll never know how much it feels during the times when hearts break every day.

And the most important thing, people have forgotten that “**it takes time for things to happen**”. Rome wasn’t built in a day. Our generation doesn’t have that patience and perseverance and When it comes to task like those, we try to find our “Passion”, our “calling” which never exist and we get bored with things quickly. (things I learnt from Simon Sinek)

But, wait a second. Are this social media and phones really that bad? We must admit, they indeed brings us closer. I still am able to be in touch with people, like my school friends, with whom I was once a pea in the pod, and we still message each other. And the best thing that I feel about these is I can get to know about many people. Also, I, sometimes do message unknown people having common interests with me, telling them about myself and then we meet and explore each other, which always turns out to be a good thing for us.

I personally believe that Human Interactions are the most beautiful things and they make the best memories in one’s life. Doesn’t matter if you’re a geek or a top-notch introvert, the truth is that we all become happy when we interact with people

But I rarely find people who think the same. It feels like the whole world’s living in a fairytale and nobody’s really observing how they’re wasting this small and priceless life. It has become a world of footsteps and phones. Fake people and fake things are becoming popular everywhere, and you rarely find genuine people these days.

But there’s one thing that I’ve surely understood. All “hot” girls are not “beautiful” and all “cool” boys are not “gentlemen”. In short, “looks are deceptive”. You should get to know a person. With time, you’ll eventually realize if the person’s your buddy or not.

But the best things in life are going on walks with random people, listening to their stories and sharing your stories with them. Making new bonds and you’ll feel that the whole world is indeed connected. That’s how we should have human interactions. When you find that someone has done this, or visited a place, go pay them a visit and you’ll know their experiences.

With all being said, We must realize that this phone is addictive, far more than anything, because everybody around you are using it (even now) and they don’t know what’s happening with them. Never let it use you. Don’t ever make it more important than a person who’s in front of you in any kind of conversation.
