Chet Holmes says in his book, “[The Ultimate Sales Machine](https://www.amazon.in/Ultimate-Sales-Machine-Turbocharge-Relentless/dp/1591842158)”,
>  **“It’s not about learning 4000 moves but doing basic and important steps 4000 times.
Despite knowing the 5 skill sets we need to master to become good at something, having thegreatest secret, still people fail. Why? Because they simply won’t do it.
*Implementation, not ideas, is the key to real success.”***

It’s so frustrating how we don’t do the important thing and instead do either the non-priority thing or nothing at all. With such beauty and smoothness, we shift to things which are not much on priority.

In my case, most of the times, I skip my Vocals practice in the morning or don’t do programming just because subconsciously the practice doesn’t feel much interesting to me. But, I know I can still take time out to do it and it’s essential.

It feels tragic to me that we’re so used to **instant gratification** that we drop out of things. We live in a world where books instantly appear on our e-readers, news travels far and wide, and just about anything can show up at our doorsteps in as little as a day.

After thinking a lot on these lines, I’ve started collaborating with people for work and joined classes for skills (like Vocals). I guess you need to find that thing that drives you. For me, competition in something which I want to do lights the fire inside me. If you find that thing, you can leverage that to your benefit.

I seriously believe that if you do things in a disciplined way parallelly, it will be good in the long term. And eventually, it’s the long term that should matter most (at least for someone in age 18–25).

Chet Holmes also mentions one more thing in productivity that I really liked,
>  “Touch it once. If you touch it, take action. Don’t open that email/message until you’re ready to deal with it. Change the subject in reply if you think that’s something else.”

I know you’ll say that’s not a new thing and is justified, but it’s tough to execute. I always jump to the email/message that I receive on the spot, and then deal with that later. Again, it’s the pigheaded discipline and determination which factors in here.

Our minds are wired to getting things instantly, but when it comes to the important things, it takes time. And that constant discipline is what I think everyone needs to master.

And that’s why I’ve now decided that I’ll write more now. And started giving myself monthly targets to what I want to do. (The feeling of competition with myself 🔥) *Let’s see how this turns out!*

— Please give your suggestions, feedback and **especially critics! ***Maybe this will help someone. 
It’s the people around you that matter. Let’s learn from each other!*

PS — I have pdf of the book, in case anyone wants.
