We need to get more and more young graduates & college students to work on climate tech products & projects ✨🚀

Having been through this myself, I shared how early career folks can decipher & break into climate tech in 2021. 🌏
PS - I had talked from the lens of a student Maya 👋 who's in her final year and wants to build on climate tech. I'm sure all young folks will relate to her.
